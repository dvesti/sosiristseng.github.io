# My progress note


## TO-DO

### Diabetes modeling

For beta-cell bioenergetcis and mitochondrial dynamics

Observations: from the Nature paper
- Basal NADH increase
- Little reaction to glucose for NADH, mitochondrial membrane potential, and respiratory rate

Proposed:
- Decreased PDH, ETC, F1Fo
- May increase Glycolysis
- May decrease Calcium uniporter


## 2020-12-16

### Fridlyand 2010 reference model

Added analysis code for fridlyand 2010 model to serve as a basis.

To test if later changes make the model too wild.

### Glucose protocol

Trying to add glucose from 5 mM to 10mM / 15mM from t = 100 instead of t = 0 using callbacks, but the model became unstable.

### Calcium dynamics

The addition of glucose would be shifted from `t=0` to `t=100` for more friendly figures.

I used timed callback for the discontinuity in the model.

Somehow numerical instability was noted upon addition of glucose at `t=100`. The old way of adding glucose at `t=0` worked fine abeit the same set of state variables.

Forcing positive domain yielded rejection by the solver.

(Updated on 12-17): You need to use a small `dt` for the large discontiuity in the ODE problem.

### Node and edge model

(Shah 2019 model)

Some translation work is on this [GitHub issue](https://github.com/sosiristseng/MitoDyn/issues/19).

The first thing I noticed was that their model had very small ratios of fusion / fission rates (0.0007 and 0.000003). Maybe it was one of the characteristics of their model with a large number of nodes.

(Updated on 12-17): The analysis showed half of the nodes are X1 (end point nodes).  Maybe `X1 / N` is analogous to `w1` in my ODE model.

Manuscript 🩹 for mitochodrial dynamics would be focused on the relationship of bioenergetics (ATP) and network status (mitochondrial dynamics).

## 2020-11-03

Got emails about Ph. D. candidate and scholarship.

## 2020-11-01

Using the same "private" GitLab pages technique, my timeline was moved here to have better access control.

The ducument and layout were also more lightweight.

## 2020-10-18

- 🚧 Fixing my personal computer in WanLong for RAM issues.
- 📓 [Python](https://github.com/NTUMitoLab/BEBI-5009/tree/main/python) notes @ [my knowledge base](https://sosiristseng.gitlab.io/).
- 🩹 Completed limitations of this model: [issue](https://giltab.com/sosiristseng/MitochondrialDynamics/issues/14)
- 🚧 : Sciwheel on Google docs stopped working. I could no longer insert citations. (Update: resolved)

## 2020-10-13

- Manuscript: Methods for the model
- Ditched the intermembrane space and utilized ANT flux and proton leak flux for fusion and fission rates, respectively.
  - No longer needs small dt

## 2020-08-25

- 🩹 Use adenylate energy charge to represent ATP/ADP/AMP levels
- 🩹 Fix the unstability problem by just setting the initial dt lower

## 2020-08-21

- 🩹 Bumped total adeninate pool from 4.0mM to 4.5 mM to get the same ATP/ADP ratio as reference model.
- 🩹 Tried to tweak parameters of NCLX but to no avail due to the strong dependence of mitochondrial membrane potential.
- 🩹 A [paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3614983/) that illustrates initial fragmentation and recovery (after 1h) during glucose stimulation.
- 🩹 Trying to make a multi-level model but I met with some numerical instability that needs to be fixed.

## 2020-08-12

- 🩹 Fixed a critical bug of the NADH Km of the NADH transporter. https://github.com/sosiristseng/mitodyn/issues/17#issue-672635006
- 🩹 [Pluto.jl](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl) reactive notebook for exploratory parameter estimation.
- 🩹 Fixing a bug in the NCLX by the original author. But the steady-state mitochodrial calcium became triphasic.
- 🩹 After fixing the mito Ca bug, I'll need to rescale the dynamics rate w.r.t ATP/ADP ratios since there was more ATP production after the fix.


## 2020-08-04

- 📓 [Netlify mirror](https://sosiristseng.netlify.app/) for my notes, sourced from [GitLab](https://sosiristseng.gitlab.io/). While my blog sits in [GitHub](https://sosiristseng.github.io/). Best to try both.

### 📓 Example sites for future use

  - [IDR](http://idr.openmicroscopy.org/)
  - [DRYAD](https://datadryad.org/)
- 🚧 Found the cause of PopOS becoming unresponsive: an incompatible piece of software. And it was smooth as butter after removing it. Using a Ubuntu-based Linux is more coherent with the rest of the lab.


## 2020-07-22

- 📓 Start to record my progress here like a [scrum board](https://gitlab.com/sosiristseng/progress/-/issues/13#note_383006357) **Link unavailable as of now**
- 📓 Various notes website here with https://sosiristseng.github.io and https://sosiristseng.gitlab.io (mirror)
- 🚧 Tried an Ubuntu variant (PopOS) and the gnome shell became unresponsive after a while. I revert it back to Manjaro KDE (with KDE plasma 5.19)

## 2020-07-16

- 🩹 GitHub project management: boards, categorized issues
- 🩹 Collecting reference for manuscript introduction e.g. examples of other methods studying mitochondrial dynamics
- 🩹 Some manuscript structure
- 📓 [Website](https://sosiristseng.github.io) is online, powered by docsify

## 2020-07-09

> My memories are fading away as of 2 weeks later. 🤔 That's why one is supposed to keep a record.

- 🩹 Adding mitochodrial GTP had minimal effect on overall steady-state ATP concentrations and
- 🩹 Adding washout rate for Pyruvate did prevent it from overaccumulation
- 📓 My Blog powered by Hexo is online

## 2020-07-02

- 🩹 Pyruvate was accumulating in the ODE model. The flux of lactate dehydrogenase was low due to low cytosolic NADH.
- 🩹 The metabolites followed sinusoid glucose wave pattern due to the former have a much shorter timescale.
- 🩹 The custom fission / fusion rates looks good
