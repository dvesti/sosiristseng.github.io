# Hugo blog setup and deployment


## Prologue

I've always wanted to write a tech blog with the abilities to
- Be looking nice ü•∞
- Be fast and responsive
- Search full-text content
- Track the progress I made (via Git version control)
- Click the keywords to browse my articles
- Display math and chemical expressions

## Comparision of static site generators

Of [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), [Hexo](https://hexo.io/), and [Docsify](https://docsify.js.org/).

### Hugo

[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) is the world‚Äôs fastest framework for building websites, written in Go.

**Pros üëç**
- Single dependency with one `hugo` excutable only.
- Extremely fast. It builds a large website within 5 seconds.
- Able to customize / override default settings without messing up the theme files.[^hugooverride]

[^hugooverride]: In Hugo, you are able to [override default layouts and settings](https://zwbetz.com/override-a-hugo-theme/) by placing counterpart file(s) in your site folder. Hugo will look at your custom setting first without messing with the theme folder, which is much more friendly for Git submodules and theme updates.

**Cons üëé**
- A limited number of extensions.
- Some GoLang knowledge are required for making templates.

**Themes**
- [codeIT](https://github.com/sunt-programator/CodeIT) : used in this blog.
- [clarity](https://github.com/chipzoller/hugo-clarity)
- [color your world](https://gitlab.com/rmaguiar/hugo-theme-color-your-world)
- [meme](https://github.com/reuixiy/hugo-theme-meme)
- [zzo](https://github.com/zzossig/hugo-theme-zzo)

### Hexo

**Pros üëç**
- A huge set of plugins thanks to the npm ecosystem.
- Plentiful Chinese resources.
- Fast. It builds a large website under 1 minute.

**Cons üëé**
- Hundreds of npm dependencies. If you are familiar with npm packages it might not be a problem.
- For LaTeX math typesetting, you need to change the renderer to either the pandoc one, which requires the `pandoc` binary or the markdown-it one, in which chemical typesetting (`mhchem`) does not work well.
- More complicated to override the templates in the theme.
- Less intuitive [asset management](https://hexo.io/docs/asset-folders.html).

**Themes**
- [Next](https://theme-next.js.org/)
- [fluid](https://fluid-dev.github.io/hexo-fluid-docs/)
- [butterfly](https://butterfly.js.org/)

### Docsify

[Docsify](https://docsify.js.org/) renders Markdown files to HTML on-the-fly.

**Pros üëç**
- Minimal dependency: just one `index.html` with JS/CSS and you're good to go.
- Fast. It skips the building step and renders Markdown file on-the-fly.
- Handy extensions on [awesome docsify](https://docsify.js.org/#/awesome).

**Cons üëé**
- No support for tags and categories.
- KaTeX extension does not support `mhchem`.

### Others

- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), the default GitHub pages SSG written in Ruby. Generating a large site is slower compared to either Hugo or Hexo, taking several minutes.
- [Nikola](https://getnikola.com/), a SSG written in Python with first-class support of Markdown (`*.md`), reStructuredText (`*.rst`) and Jupyter Notebook (`*.ipynb`) files.
- [JupyterBook](https://jupyterbook.org), powered by the [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) python documentation generator, builds beautiful, publication-quality books and documents from Markdown (`*.md`), reStructuredText (`*.rst`) and Jupyter Notebook (`*.ipynb`) files.

### Conclusion

Right now I use Hugo with codeIT theme in my blog (see the footer), but keep some templates in case I need to make the switch.

- Docsify: <https://github.com/sosiristseng/template-docsify>


## The quick way

Using [my template site](https://github.com/sosiristseng/template-hugo-codeit) is the quickest way to get started. It includes
- Powerful [CodeIT](https://github.com/sunt-programator/CodeIT/) theme installed as a Git submodule
- I added some useful shortcodes from the Color yourworld theme.

You'll have to edit the `baseURL` entry in `config.toml` to your domain.

### GitHub hosting

Click `Use the template` button at [my template](https://github.com/sosiristseng/template-hugo-clarity) to copy the pre-configured Hugo with MemE theme.

The template comes with proper GitHub actions to build and deploy the website on the `gh-pages` branch. But you'll need to activate GitHub pages in the repo setting.

The example CI/CD file `.github/workflows/gh-pages.yml` to setup automatic website deployment for GitHub pages

```yml
name: github pages

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: checkout master
      uses: actions/checkout@v2
      with:
        submodules: true  # Fetch Hugo themes (true OR recursive)
        fetch-depth: 0    # Fetch all history for .GitInfo and .Lastmod
    - name: Setup Hugo
      uses: peaceiris/actions-hugo@v2
      with:
        hugo-version: 'latest'
        extended: true
    - name: Build
      run: hugo --gc --minify
    - name: Deploy
      uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
      with:
        github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        publish_dir: ./public
        force_orphan: true
        full_commit_message: ${{ github.event.head_commit.message }}
```

### GitLab hosting

1. Click [import project](https://gitlab.com/projects/new#import_project) and select `Repo by URL`.
1. Copy and paste the git url from [my template](https://github.com/sosiristseng/template-hugo-clarity).

My template includes a `.gitlab-ci.yml` for automatic site building when changes are pushed into GitLab.

You'll need to modify the `HUGO_BASE_URL` entry in `.gitlab-ci.yml` to the URL of yoursite for the website to work properly.

The example CI/CD file `.gitlab-ci.yml` to setup automatic website deployment for GitLab pages

```yml
image: klakegg/hugo:ext-alpine-ci

variables:
  GIT_SUBMODULE_STRATEGY: recursive
  HUGO_BASE_URL: 'https://sosiristseng.gitlab.io/'

test:
  script:
  - hugo -b ${HUGO_BASE_URL}
  except:
  - main

pages:
  script:
  - apk add --update brotli
  - hugo --gc --minify -b ${HUGO_BASE_URL}
  - find public -type f -regex '.*\.\(htm\|html\|txt\|text\|js\|css\|svg\|xml\)$' -exec gzip   -f -k {} \; || echo 'Gzip failed. Skipping...'
  - find public -type f -regex '.*\.\(htm\|html\|txt\|text\|js\|css\|svg\|xml\)$' -exec brotli -f -k {} \; || echo 'Brotli failed. Skipping...'
  artifacts:
    paths:
    - public
  only:
  - main
```
