## Prologue

I've always wanted to write a tech blog with the abilities to
- Be looking nice ü•∞
- Be fast and responsive
- Search full-text content
- Track the progress I made (via Git version control)
- Click the keywords to browse my articles
- Display math and chemical expressions

## Comparision of static site generators

Of [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), [Hexo](https://hexo.io/), and [Docsify](https://docsify.js.org/).

### Hugo

[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) is the world‚Äôs fastest framework for building websites, written in Go.

**Pros üëç**
- Single dependency with one `hugo` excutable only.
- Extremely fast. It builds a large website within 5 seconds.
- Able to customize / override default settings without messing up the theme files.[^hugooverride]

[^hugooverride]: In Hugo, you are able to [override default layouts and settings](https://zwbetz.com/override-a-hugo-theme/) by placing counterpart file(s) in your site folder. Hugo will look at your custom setting first without messing with the theme folder, which is much more friendly for Git submodules and theme updates.

**Cons üëé**
- A limited number of extensions.
- Some GoLang knowledge are required for making templates.

**Themes**
- [codeIT](https://github.com/sunt-programator/CodeIT) : used in this blog.
- [clarity](https://github.com/chipzoller/hugo-clarity)
- [color your world](https://gitlab.com/rmaguiar/hugo-theme-color-your-world)
- [meme](https://github.com/reuixiy/hugo-theme-meme)
- [zzo](https://github.com/zzossig/hugo-theme-zzo)

### Hexo

**Pros üëç**
- A huge set of plugins thanks to the npm ecosystem.
- Plentiful Chinese resources.
- Fast. It builds a large website under 1 minute.

**Cons üëé**
- Hundreds of npm dependencies. If you are familiar with npm packages it might not be a problem.
- For LaTeX math typesetting, you need to change the renderer to either the pandoc one, which requires the `pandoc` binary or the markdown-it one, in which chemical typesetting (`mhchem`) does not work well.
- More complicated to override the templates in the theme.
- Less intuitive [asset management](https://hexo.io/docs/asset-folders.html).

**Themes**
- [Next](https://theme-next.js.org/)
- [fluid](https://fluid-dev.github.io/hexo-fluid-docs/)
- [butterfly](https://butterfly.js.org/)

### Docsify

[Docsify](https://docsify.js.org/) renders Markdown files to HTML on-the-fly.

**Pros üëç**
- Minimal dependency: just one `index.html` with JS/CSS and you're good to go.
- Fast. It skips the building step and renders Markdown file on-the-fly.
- Handy extensions on [awesome docsify](https://docsify.js.org/#/awesome).

**Cons üëé**
- No support for tags and categories.
- KaTeX extension does not support `mhchem`.

### Others

- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), the default GitHub pages SSG written in Ruby. Generating a large site is slower compared to either Hugo or Hexo, taking several minutes.
- [Nikola](https://getnikola.com/), a SSG written in Python with first-class support of Markdown (`*.md`), reStructuredText (`*.rst`) and Jupyter Notebook (`*.ipynb`) files.
- [JupyterBook](https://jupyterbook.org), powered by the [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) python documentation generator, builds beautiful, publication-quality books and documents from Markdown (`*.md`), reStructuredText (`*.rst`) and Jupyter Notebook (`*.ipynb`) files.

### Conclusion

Right now I use Hugo with codeIT theme in my blog (see the footer), but keep some templates in case I need to make the switch.

## How to set up a Hugo blog

{{< admonition type=tip >}}

If you prefer a do-it-yourself way to set up your Hugo blog, follow the [theme documentation](https://codeit.suntprogramator.dev/theme-documentation-basics/) instead.

{{< /admonition >}}

Use [my template site](https://github.com/sosiristseng/template-hugo-codeit) for a quick start. It includes
- Powerful [CodeIT](https://github.com/sunt-programator/CodeIT/) theme installed as a Git submodule
- Some useful shortcodes were added from color your world theme.
- CI/CD routine for GitHub actions and GitLab CICD. The website will be built and deploy automatically upon pushing the changes.

{{< admonition type=note >}}
After copying, you have to change the `baseURL` entry in `config.toml`.

```toml
baseURL = "www.example.com/" # With trailing slash
```
{{< /admonition >}}

### GitHub hosting

Click the {{< kbd "Use the template" >}} button at [my template repository](https://github.com/sosiristseng/template-hugo-clarity).

The website will be deployed on the `gh-pages` branch. Be sure to activate GitHub pages, pointing to root in the `gh-pages` branch, in the repository setting.

### GitLab hosting

1. Click [import project](https://gitlab.com/projects/new#import_project) and select `Repo by URL`.
1. Copy and paste the git url from [my template](https://github.com/sosiristseng/template-hugo-clarity).

{{< admonition type=note >}}
You'll need to modify the `HUGO_BASE_URL` entry in `.gitlab-ci.yml` to your domain for the website to build properly.
