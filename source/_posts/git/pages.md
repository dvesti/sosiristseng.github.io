## GitHub pages
- Grabs webpages from the root (`/`) or `docs` folder. You could choose which git branch to hold the pages.
- [Built-in](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/working-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site) Jekyll static site generator requiring little setup from your side.
- You could use other static site generators (e.g. Hugo, Hexo) by setting up [GitHub actions](https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-gh-pages).
- The connection to the built website is [pretty fast](https://www.jeremymorgan.com/blog/programming/how-fast-are-github-pages/).

## GitLab pages

[Getting started](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/pages/#getting-started)

- You must setup a gitlab CI job, where pages should be published in the `public` folder and uploaded as an artifact. For example,
  ```yaml
  image: ruby:2.7
  pages:
    script:
    - gem install bundler
    - bundle install
    - bundle exec jekyll build -d public
    artifacts:
      paths:
      - public
  ```
- Therefore, GitLab pages are more complicated to set up but more flexible.
- Larger repository size limit (10 GB vs 1GB from GitHub)
- More [custom domains](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/pages/custom_domains_ssl_tls_certification/)
- You can set [private pages](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/pages/pages_access_control.html) requiring log in and approval to visit.

## Conclusion

Right I use GitHub pages for my blog for faster connection speed, but leave a mirror hosted by GitLab pages in case GitHub is down.
