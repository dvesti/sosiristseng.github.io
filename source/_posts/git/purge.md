Erase all history in the Git repo to start anew with all the remaining files.

Useful when you accidentally added a big binary file and want to delete it in the database (and don'tcare about git commit history)

<!--more-->

```bash
git checkout --orphan newBranch
git add -A  # Add all files and commit them
git commit
git branch -D master       # Deletes the master branch
git branch -m master       # Rename the current branch to master
git push -f origin master  # Force push master branch to remote (e.g. github)
git gc --aggressive --prune=all     # remove the old files
```
