[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) has some $\LaTeX$ math [rendering issue](https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/issues/1679) from its Markdown [parser](https://github.com/yuin/goldmark). I moved my blog from Hugo to [Hexo](https://hexo.io/) since Latex math rendering is of high priority.

<!-- more -->

The Goldmark parser would treat the underscore `_` and the backslash `\` as Markdown syntax and disrupt math rendering by MathJax[^mathjax] or KaTeX[^katex]. The original parser in Hexo, `hexo-renderer-marked`, also has similar issues, but it could be replaced with other ones [^hrpandoc][^hrmi] with serve-side math rendering[^hexofiltermathjax][^markdownitlatex2img] that works perfectly with math blocks with good cleint-side performance.

## Comparision of both static site generators

## Other static site generators on my radar

- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), the default GitHub pages SSG. The performance for generating a lot of posts is to be desired.
- [Nikola](https://getnikola.com/), a SSG with first-class support of `*.md`[^md], `*.rst`[^rst] and *.ipynb`[^ipynb] files.
- [JupyterBook](https://jupyterbook.org), building beautiful, publication-quality books and documents from computational material with executable code blocks. It supports (extended) `*.md`[^md], `*.rst`[^rst] and `*.ipynb`[^ipynb] and is built on Sphinx[^sphinx].
- [fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages), an easy to use blogging platform Built on Jekyll and GitHub actions, with enhanced support for Jupyter Notebooks (but you still eed escaping sequence for LaTeX math).

[^hugotaxonomies]: Hugo treats tags and categories orthogonally, both being a part of the taxonomy system, while Hexo sees tags as non-hierarchical, categories as hierarchical structures for post relationship.
[^hugooverride]: In Hugo, you are able to override the default layout / settings by placing a counterpart file in your site without messing with the theme folder, which is Much more friendly for Git submodules and theme updates. While in Hexo, you may need to edit the settings inside the themes folder, causing conflicts when the theme updates.
