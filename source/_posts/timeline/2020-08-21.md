- 🩹 Bumped total adeninate pool from 4.0mM to 4.5 mM to get the same ATP/ADP ratio as reference model.
- 🩹 Tried to tweak parameters of NCLX but to no avail due to the strong dependence of mitochondrial membrane potential.
- 🩹 A [paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3614983/) that illustrates initial fragmentation and recovery (after 1h) during glucose stimulation.
- 🩹 Trying to make a multi-level model but I met with some numerical instability that needs to be fixed.
