- 🩹 [Resolved] After imported from GitHub, constant pop-ups of errors about issue comment. I just replaced them with new ones.
- 📓 [Netlify mirror](https://sosiristseng.netlify.app/) for my notes, sourced from [GitLab](https://sosiristseng.gitlab.io/). While my blog sits in [GitHub](https://sosiristseng.github.io/). Best to try both.

## 📓 Example sites for future use

- [Technical documentation with markdown](https://gitlab.com/sosiris-eg/docsify)
- [Compiling LaTex on GitLab](https://gitlab.com/sosiris-eg/tex)
- [Scheduled](https://gitlab.com/sosiris-eg/periodic-release) [report generators](https://gitlab.com/sosiris-eg/changelog-generator)
- Blog on GitHub: one by [Hugo](https://github.com/sosiristseng/site-academic), and one by [Hexo](https://github.com/sosiristseng/site-hexo-next)

## 🛠️ Tooling

- Found some online repositories for bioimages (e.g. microscopy images) suggested by [Nature](https://www.nature.com/sdata/policies/repositories)
  - [IDR](http://idr.openmicroscopy.org/)
  - [DRYAD](https://datadryad.org/)
- 🚧 Found the cause of PopOS becoming unresponsive: an incompatible piece of software. And it was smooth as butter after removing it. Using a Ubuntu-based Linux is more coherent with the rest of the lab.
