Some results for the manuscript.

<!-- more -->

## Timeline changes

My new progress is posted [here](https://sosiristseng.github.io/categories/timeline/).

## Fridlyand 2010 reference model

Added analysis code for fridlyand 2010 model to serve as a basis.

To test if later changes make the model too wild.

## Glucose protocol

Trying to add glucose from 5 mM to 10mM / 15mM from t = 100 instead of t = 0 using callbacks, but the model became unstable.

## Calcium dynamics

The addition of glucose would be shifted from `t=0` to `t=100` for more friendly figures.

I used timed callback for the discontinuity in the model.

Somehow numerical instability was noted upon addition of glucose at `t=100`. The old way of adding glucose at `t=0` worked fine abeit the same set of state variables.

Forcing positive domain yielded rejection by the solver.

## Node and edge model

(Shah 2019 model)

Some translation work is on this [GitHub issue](https://github.com/sosiristseng/MitoDyn/issues/19).

The first thing I noticed was that their model had very small ratios of fusion / fission rates (0.0007 and 0.000003). Maybe it was one of the characteristics of their model with a large number of nodes.
